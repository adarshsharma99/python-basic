        "2. What is an Interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- An interpreter is a program that directly executes the instructions in a programming language, line by line, without compiling the code first. In Python, the interpreter plays a crucial role in executing Python code.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python\n",
        "- Predefined Keywords in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, keywords are reserved words that have special meanings and cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers. Here are some examples of predefined keywords in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of Keywords\n",
        "1. Control Flow:\n",
        "    - if\n",

        "\n",
        "4.  Can keywords be used as variable names\n",
        "-  No, keywords cannot be used as a variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python\n",
        "- Mutability in Python\n",
        "If you're referring to mutability, it's a fundamental concept in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutability refers to the ability of an object to change its state after creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutable Objects\n",
        "In Python, some objects are mutable, meaning their contents can be modified after creation. Examples include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Lists: [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "2. Dictionaries: {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}\n",
        "3. Sets: {1, 2, 3}\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable Objects\n",
        "Other objects are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be modified after creation. Examples include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Integers: 5\n",
        "2. Strings: \"hello\"\n",
        "3. Tuples: (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding mutability is crucial in Python programming, as it affects how objects are passed around and modified in your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n",
        "- lists are mutable because they are designed for modification, while tuples are immutable because they are designed for constancy and thread safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python\n",
        "- ## \"==\" Operator\n",
        "The == operator in Python checks for equality between two values. It returns True if the values are equal and False otherwise.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "a = 5\n",
        "b = 5\n",
        "print(a == b)  # Output: True\n",
        "## \"is\" Operator\n",
        "The is operator in Python checks for identity between two objects. It returns True if both variables refer to the same object in memory and False otherwise.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "print(a == b)  # Output: True (values are equal)\n",
        "print(a is b)  # Output: False (not the same object in memory)\n",
        "## Key Differences\n",
        "1. Equality vs Identity: == checks for equality of values, while is checks for identity of objects.\n",
        "2. Memory Location: is checks if both variables point to the same memory location, whereas == checks if the values are equal, regardless of memory location.\n",
        "\n",
        "## When to Use Each\n",
        "1. Use == for value comparisons: When you want to check if two values are equal.\n",
        "2. **Use\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python\n",
        "- Python has three logical operators:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. and: Returns True if both conditions are true.\n",
        "2. or: Returns True if at least one condition is true.\n",
        "3. not: Returns the opposite of the condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python\n",
        "- Type casting is the process of converting one data type into another. In Python, you can use various functions to cast variables from one type to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n",
        "- Key Differences\n",
        "1. Automatic vs Manual: Implicit type casting is automatic, while explicit type casting requires manual intervention.\n",
        "2. Control: Explicit type casting gives the programmer more control over the conversion process.\n",
        "3. Potential Errors: Implicit type casting can sometimes lead to unexpected results or errors, while explicit type casting can help catch errors earlier.\n",
        "\n",
        "When to Use Each\n",
        "1. Use implicit type casting: When the conversion is straightforward and doesn't require specific control.\n",
        "2. Use explicit type casting: When you need to ensure a specific data type or want to avoid potential errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python\n",
        "- Conditional statements are used to control the flow of a program based on specific conditions or decisions. They allow you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false.\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of Conditional Statements\n",
        "1. if statement: Used to execute a block of code if a condition is true.\n",
        "2. elif statement: Used to check another condition if the initial condition is false.\n",
        "3. else statement: Used to execute a block of code if all conditions are false.\n",

        "Purpose\n",
        "The purpose of conditional statements is to:\n",
        "\n",

        "2. Handle different scenarios: Write code that can adapt to different situations or inputs.\n",
        "3. Improve program logic: Use conditional statements to create more complex and dynamic program logic.\n",

        "    # code to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true\n",
        "How it Works\n",
        "1. Initial condition evaluation: The if condition is evaluated.\n",
        "2. Elif evaluation: If the if condition is false, the elif condition is evaluated.\n",
        "3. Code execution: If the elif condition is true, the code indented under the elif statement is executed.\n",

        "- For and while\n",
        "Key Differences\n",
        "1. Iteration: for loops iterate over a sequence, while while loops iterate based on a condition.\n",
        "2. Termination: for loops terminate when the sequence is exhausted, while while loops terminate when the condition becomes false.\n",
        "3. Control: for loops provide less control over the iteration process, while while loops provide more control.\n",

        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "- ## Scenario: User Input Validation\n",
        "Imagine you're writing a program that asks the user to input a password. You want to ensure that the password meets certain criteria, such as having a minimum length. You can use a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for input until they enter a valid password.\n",

        "### Example\n",
        "password = input(\"Enter a password (min 8 characters): \")\n",

        "    password = input(\"Enter a password (min 8 characters): \")\n",
        "print(\"Password accepted!\")\n",
        "## Why While Loop is More Suitable\n",
        "1. Unknown number of iterations: You don't know how many times the user will need to enter a password before it meets the criteria.\n",
        "2. Conditional termination: The loop terminates when the user enters a valid password, which is a condition that needs to be evaluated.\n",
        "\n",
